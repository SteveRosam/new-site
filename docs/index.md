# Consolidate your data, models and configurations in one platform

Hardware engineers use the SimuFlow platform to digitize physical systems. Because digital is always faster and cheaper than physical.

## Use Cases

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ### Accelerate Product Development
    
    ---
    
    Deliver high-quality products faster with an integrated, model-based data platform. Reduce risk, shorten timelines, and close the design-validation loop using real-time data from test rigs, fleets, and simulations.

## The SimuFlow Platform

### What is SimuFlow?

SimuFlow is an open, lightweight platform that integrates your live data into existing Model-Based Development tools (like MATLAB, Simulink and Modelica) to consolidate your R&D workflows. Additionally, SimuFlow provides solution accelerators for key workflows, including data transformation, asset, model, test and simulation configuration as well as cataloging data, simulation and test results in a centralized cloud data platform.

### Core Capabilities

- **Real-time Data Integration**  
  Connect to any data source and stream high-frequency time series data with sub-millisecond latency. Built-in connectors for MQTT, Kafka, OPC-UA, and more.

- **Time-Series Database**  
  Purpose-built time-series database optimized for high-velocity sensor data with automatic downsampling, retention policies, and efficient compression.

- **Stream Processing**  
  Process streaming data in real-time with Python or SQL. Run complex event processing, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics on live data streams.

- **Model Serving**  
  Deploy and serve machine learning models as scalable microservices with automatic scaling and versioning. Support for ONNX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch models.

- **Visualization & Monitoring**  
  Real-time dashboards and monitoring tools to visualize data streams, set alerts, and track system health.

- **Enterprise Security**  
  End-to-end encryption, role-based access control, and audit logging to meet enterprise security and compliance requirements.
