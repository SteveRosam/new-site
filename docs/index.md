# Consolidate your data, models and configurations in one platform

Hardware engineers use the SimuFlow platform to digitize physical systems. Because digital is always faster and cheaper than physical.

## Use Cases

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ### Accelerate Product Development
    
    ---
    
    Deliver high-quality products faster with an integrated, model-based data platform. Reduce risk, shorten timelines, and close the design-validation loop using real-time data from test rigs, fleets, and simulations.

- ### Optimize Production Processes
    
    ---
    
    Develop novel processes by running model-based experiments on live rig data. Connect high-fidelity models to live production data to automate processes and continuously optimize performance.

## Case Studies

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ### Hardware Devices
    
    **Viessmann** uses SimuFlow to accelerate R&D of clean energy HVAC products. By collecting a high-quality catalog of tests, configurations, models and simulations, and running rapid experiments, they reduce design-validation cycle time by 50%.

- ### Manufacturing
    
    **CloudNC** leverages SimuFlow to optimize and automate CNC machines. By modeling cutting processes, CloudNC can optimize CAM profiles, anticipate tool breakages, and predict production cycle times. This improves Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) by over 5%.

## The SimuFlow Platform

### What is SimuFlow?

SimuFlow is an open, lightweight platform that integrates your live data into existing Model-Based Development tools (like MATLAB, Simulink and Modelica) to consolidate your R&D workflows. Additionally, SimuFlow provides solution accelerators for key workflows, including data transformation, asset, model, test and simulation configuration as well as cataloging data, simulation and test results in a centralized cloud data platform.

### Core Capabilities

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **Real-time Data Integration**
  - Collect real-world data from any test rig, device, asset or fleet
  - Create a high-quality, centralized data repository with an indexed catalog
  
- **Configuration Management**
  - Configure devices, tests, models and simulations with version control
  - Record every version of every experiment in the data catalog

- **Run Experiments**
  - Serve models and automate simulations with simple workflows
  - Containerized environments designed specifically for hardware engineers

- **Virtual Engineering**
  - Discover data from old programs and reprocess it with new models
  - Accelerate new product concepts through virtual prototyping
