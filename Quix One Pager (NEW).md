# Consolidate your data, models and configurations in one platform

Hardware engineers use the Quix data and simulation platform to digitise physical systems. Because digital is always faster and cheaper than physical.

### Use cases

| Accelerate product development | Optimize production processes | Reduce asset downtime |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Deliver high-quality products faster with an integrated, model-based data platform. Reduce risk, shorten timelines, and close the designâ€“validation loop using real-time data from test rigs, fleets, and simulations. | Develop novel processes by running model-based experiments on live rig data. Connect high-fidelity models to live production data to automate processes and continuously optimise performance through real-world feedback loops. | Monitor complex, distributed assets and predict failures by connecting live data to high-fidelity models. Quickly evolve models through iterative experiments and continuous learning from operational feedback. |

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Viessmann uses Quix to accelerate R\&D of clean energy HVAC products.  By collecting a high-quality catalog of tests, configurations, models and simulations, and running rapid experiments, they reduce design-validation cycle time by 50%. | CloudNC leverages Quix to optimize and automate CNC machines.  By modelling cutting processes, CloudNC can optimize CAM profiles, anticipate tool breakages, and predict production cycle times. This improves Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) by over 5%. | Juniz uses Quix to monitor complex battery plants distributed across Germany.  By modelling batteries at the cell-level and running them on live plant data, they can cost-effectively manage battery usage and proactively detect battery faults, saving significant downtime costs. |

### Quix data and simulation platform

**What is Quix?** Quix is an open, lightweight platform that integrates your live data into existing Model-Based Development tools (like MATLAB, Simulink and Modelica) to consolidate your R\&D workflows. Additionally, Quix provides solution accelerators for key workflows, including data transformation, asset, model, test and simulation configuration as well as cataloging data, simulation and test results in a centralised cloud data platform.

**What does Quix do for my R\&D team?** Quix enables you to transition from existing workflows based on legacy desktop technologies and data in files to a centralised data & simulation infrastructure that facilitates collaboration and accelerates the design-validation cycle.   
**How is Quix different?** Unlike MBSE tools (which lack live data integration), IoT platforms (which lack deep modeling capabilities), and Big Data infrastructure (which lacks hardware engineering workflows), Quix bridges the gap between real-world data, R\&D tools, and Big Data technologies to provide workflows for hardware engineering teams.

### Core capabilities

**Real-time data integration.** Collect real-world data from any test rig, device, asset or fleet and create a high-quality, centralized data repository with an indexed catalog.  
**Configuration management.** Configure devices, tests, models and simulations with version control. Record every version of every experiment in the data catalog.  
**Run experiments.** Serve models and automate simulations with simple workflows and containers designed specifically for hardware engineers.  
**Engineer physical devices, virtually.** Discover data from old programmes and reprocess it with new models to get ahead of new product concepts.
